# Bio of Xiong Lin

I'm a research engineer of Learning & Vision, Core Technology Group, Panasonic R&D Center Singapore (PRDCSG). I received Ph.D degree of pattern recognition & intelligent system from school of electronic engineering, Xidian University. My Master's superviser is [Prof. ZHANG li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li_Zhang80/info) and Ph.D superviser is [Prof. JIAO licheng](http://web.xidian.edu.cn/lchjiao/indexen.html). I am working on developing deep neural network models and algorithm for face detection, face recognition, image generation and instance segmentation.

## Research Interests:

Unconstrained/large-scale face recognition, deep learning architecture engineering, person re-identification, transfer learning, Riemannian manifold optimization, sparse and low-rank matrix factorization.

## News:

Jan 2018: As a Chinese Tech-oriented media, AI Era gave a [full interview](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/s9H_OXX-CCakrTAQUFDm8g) for our NIST IJB-A Face Challenge. Our latest performance of IJB-A will be updated in the next version of our [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00438) paper. 

May 2017: Panasonic released a [news](http://news.panasonic.com/jp/press/data/2017/05/jn170510-5/jn170510-5.html) to introduce our project and report our archievent on IJB-A Face Verification and Identification Challenge. Moreover, [CNET Japan](https://japan.cnet.com/article/35100942/) also picked up the story.

Apr 2017: We proposed Transferred Deep Feature Fusion (TDFF) for face recogntion and obtained No.1 place on all tracks of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A) Unconstrained Face Verification and Identification Challenge. Official reports can be found in here: [Identification](https://github.com/bruinxiong/xionglin.github.io/blob/master/IJBA_1N_report.pdf) and [Verification](https://github.com/bruinxiong/xionglin.github.io/blob/master/IJBA_11_report.pdf)Â
