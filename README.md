# Bio of Xiong Lin

I'm a research engineer of Learning & Vision, Core Technology Group, Panasonic R&D Center Singapore (PRDCSG). I received Ph.D degree of pattern recognition & intelligent system from school of electronic engineering, Xidian University. My Master's superviser is [Prof. ZHANG li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li_Zhang80/info) and Ph.D superviser is [Prof. JIAO licheng](http://web.xidian.edu.cn/lchjiao/indexen.html). I am working on developing deep neural network models and algorithm for face detection, face recognition, image generation and instance segmentation.

## Research Interests:

Unconstrained/large-scale face recognition, deep learning architecture engineering, person re-identification, transfer learning, Riemannian manifold optimization, sparse and low-rank matrix factorization.

## News:

Apr 2017: We proposed Transferred Deep Feature Fusion (TDFF) for face recogntion and obtained No.1 place on all tracks of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A) Unconstrained Face Verification and Identification challenge.
